Generally, while creating a web application, multiple buttons are used. While some are unique in a way, most of them are similar to each other. And those which are similar, also have similar styles(Not 100%)

You want to create a reusable button component called ButtonView using styled components which can be modified based on the properties that are being passed.

The ButtonView component should display an outlined button by default. The button should have a black border and text and white background.

The ButtonView styled component should have the following properties

- filled - Displays a button with a black background and white text by default
- bgColor- Changes the background color of the filled button
- color - Changes the text color of the filled button

Note: bgColor and color should only apply styles to a filled button.
